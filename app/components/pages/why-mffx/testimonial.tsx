      "I really like that MyFundedFX offers no commission on all their instruments. FX pairs has great tight spreads and hopefully indices spread will be improved soon. Along with that, their customer service is awesome and replies to you as quickly as possible to help you sort out any questions or problems you have. Pricing is also very competitive and the firm releases promo codes, allowing traders to lower the price. Overall, great firm by far and the CEO, Matt, is very transparent with his traders.",
